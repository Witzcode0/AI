What is NumPy?
--------------
    - NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a Python library used for:
    - Numerical computing
    - Working with arrays
    - Performing mathematical and scientific operations

Why Use NumPy?
--------------
    - Faster than Python lists (C-based performance)
    - Supports multi-dimensional arrays
    - Performs element-wise operations
    - Has built-in mathematical functions
    - Efficient memory usage
    - Used in Data Science and Machine Learning
    - Supports broadcasting
    - Powerful linear algebra tools
    - Random number generation
    - Foundation for libraries like Pandas, SciPy, TensorFlow
